## Objective

Estimate soil water content of the entire root-zone from surface observations using an exponential filter model

## Outcomes

I would like to predict the soil moisture in the entire profile (0 to 80 cm) from soil moisture mesurements at surface (o to 15 cm) depth.


## Rationale

Accurate measurement of soil water content is critical to accomplishing sustainable and high-performance irrigation farming. Local observations of soil moisture at multiple-depth are considered one of the best alternatives to track root-zone soil water moisture but it is hard to implement in productions fields. An innovative alternative to tackle this is using field observations from a single sensor at the surface (0-15cm) and predict the entire root-zone moisture though an exponential filter model.

Exponential filter model is a semi-mechanistic model to estimate soil water index (SWI) of the root-zone from the soil observations at the surface. The model present only 3 parameters, SWISURF that represent the soil moisture observet at the surface, SURFMAX that represent the maximum amount of water that the surface can hold and K is a parameter that range between 0 to 1 and is realted to the gaps between observations.

Available soil moisture data from Kansas Mesonet and field experiments will be used to training and validating the model.
